What is the first thing to do when writing a c++ code?
-> To write the skeleton of the code

Let's say we have to print our name. In such cases, you have to give output, or in some other cases you t=have to take in an input. So in order to take an input or give an output, we have to use the library ```iostream```. Other libraries which are often useful are ```math.h``` and ```string.h```.

### Data Types
Since we are talking about input and output, let's say we need to take in a number as an input, then we also need to store it somewhere in your program. The place where we store this information can be your data type. The data types in c++ are:
* Primary or Builtin Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. Primary data types are:
  1. Integer
  2. Character
  3. Boolean
  4. Floating Point
  5. Double Floating Point
  6. Valueless or Void
  7. Wide Character

* Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
  1. Function
  2. Array
  3. Pointer
  4. Reference

* Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
  1. Class
  2. Structure
  3. Union
  4. Enumeration
  5. Typedef defined Datatype.
